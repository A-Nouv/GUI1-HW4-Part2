# GUI1-HW4-Part2

Part 2 builds upon Part 1, where sliders are implemented and have a two-way binding with their respective input fields.
The multiplication table is dynamically updated and displayed when the user inputs / slides to correct values for each field.

In addition, the user is supposed to be able to save multiplication tables that can be viewed when a tab is selected. The user can delete tabs individually, or select multiple tabs and delete them all at once. 

Unfortunately, I was unable to get the saved table to display properly, or being able to select multiple tabs to delete them all at once.
